#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! An easily reusable game bot for deterministic games.
//!
//! It is required to implement the trait [`Game`][game] for your game to use this crate.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! A game where you win by selecting `10`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::ops::RangeInclusive;
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct ChooseTen;
//!
//! impl rubot::Game for ChooseTen {
//!     /// there is only one player, you!
//!     type Player = ();
//!     type Action = u8;
//!     /// did you choose a 10?
//!     type Fitness = bool;
//!     type Actions = RangeInclusive<u8>;
//!
//!     fn actions(&self, _: Self::Player) -> (bool, Self::Actions) {
//!         (true, 1..=10)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn execute(&mut self, action: &u8, _: Self::Player) -> Self::Fitness {
//!         *action == 10
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     use rubot::Bot;
//!     use std::time::Duration;
//!
//!     let mut bot = Bot::new(());
//!     assert_eq!(
//!         bot.select(&ChooseTen, Duration::from_secs(1)),
//!         Some(10)
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Please visit the [examples folder][ex] or the [`trait Game`][game] documentation
//! for more realistic examples.
